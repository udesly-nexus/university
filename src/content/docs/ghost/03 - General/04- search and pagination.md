Search and pagination are 2 features provided only for premium users of Udesly App. In order to work, this feature leverages the content api of Ghost to enable 2 functionalities that actually Ghost doesn't provide out of box.

In order to work you must provide a content api key, that you can generate from Ghost admin dashboard.

Follow the path: Settings > Integrations.

And press on the button **Add Custom Integration**, give to it any name you wish, and copy the Content api key that ghost generated for you.
