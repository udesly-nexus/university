Memberships setup in Ghost is pretty straightforward, you basically have to do nothing in Webflow, since Ghost uses a portal system. 

All the settings you need can be found directly inside Ghost Admin panel from: Settings > Memberships > Portal Settings

But if you want to use some specific links of the portals in Webflow you have just to press on Links tab of the previous Screenshot, and Ghost will enumerate all the links you can use on your site
