The **Udesly App** is a web app that allows you to *adapt* your Webflow theme in order to be used with different CMSes.  


## Why?

Why you should use the *Udesly App* in the first place? ðŸ¤”

Webflow! an amazing design tool! ðŸŽ¨ And we wanted to use Webflow everyday and in every kind of projects!

Every tool has its own *pros*, *cons* and *best use cases*, but we didn't want to give up on Webflow at least as design tool when our customers needed a different CMS or needed to cover functionalities not yet available. 

That's why we built up the **App**, to use Webflow **all the time**... And also to not bother up our devs with boring task like *writing html markup*...

It's just a way to mix up different tools and get the best of all worlds! âœ¨

In this case, let's be specific and let's start our journey to use Webflow with [**Ghost**](https://ghost.org/). 

## Ghost?!
Ghost is a powerful app for new-media creators to publish, share, and grow a business around their content. It comes with modern tools to build a website, publish content, send newsletters & offer paid subscriptions to members.

Ghost is open source, independent, and funded 100% by its users.

### When I should use Ghost?!

Ghost is well suited if you want to have an efficient blog that you want to monetize using paid subscriptions. Ghost has a built-in portal that allows in few clicks to create gated contents area. Data is really secure and not hidden with css/js. 

Ghost is open source and even if Ghost developers created [**Ghost(Pro)**](https://ghost.org/pricing/) platform that it's pretty cheap (starting from 9$/month), you can host Ghost wherever you want, AWS, DigitalOcean any hosting that supports NodeJS is suitable for Ghost. Your data, your choice!


## Requirements

In order to use the App you need to meet the following requirements:

* An active Udesly plan (**Premium** or **All Access**);
