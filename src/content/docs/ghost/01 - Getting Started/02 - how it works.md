The **Udesly App** converts your Webflow project .zip into a [**Ghost**](https://ghost.org/) theme. It analyzes your theme and adds all the necessary *Handlebars* code, so that you don't need to! 

The **Udesly App** is smart enough to understand your Site structure through the **magic extension**, it will automatically configure your template and export your *CMS data*. Yep, you have read it correctly!

Your CMS collections will be automatically linked and editable from Ghost CMS admin panel. But take in mind that Ghost is a Blog platform. So you have to use the same structure that Ghost uses for the CMS. The extension will not allow you to export your Webflow project if the CMS you created is not suitable to be used by Ghost. 

So if you plan to use Ghost, before starting your Webflow project, create the correct [**CMS structure**](/ghost/getting-started/cms-structure).
