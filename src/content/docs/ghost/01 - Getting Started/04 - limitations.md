Wellâ€¦ not all that glitters is gold!

Below you can find a list of limitations that hopefully will be resolved in the future, but you should be aware before converting.

## Udesly App

* Some CMS visibility conditions are not mapped yet;

## Ghost

* Ghost is a specific platform, made for just one purpose: Blogging. And it does it in a fantastic way, but more than that, you can't model the platform differently. If the CMS ghost has is not enough for you, if you need a lot of custom fields or eCommerce: Don't use Ghost, use another platform;

* Forms: Ghost has no built-in forms support, if you want to create a contact form, you are forced to use a third party service;
