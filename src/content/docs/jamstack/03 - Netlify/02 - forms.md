Every form that in Webflow has as action (webflow default) as in the following screen

![](/images/form-name.png)

Will be converted as a Netlify Form.

Netlify forms can be pretty expensive, the free tier has a low usage for free.If you don't want to use Netlify Forms you have different options:

1. Select a third party forms provider from [**this list**](https://jamstacktools.org/browse/all/form) that has a lower pricing;

2. Create a [*function to deploy on Netlify*](/jamstack/netlify/functions);

For both options, you just have to set the correct action in your Webflow Form.
