With JamStack you can create also eCommerce websites by just integrating some services! There is a common misconception that static websites can't really handle or offer some of the basic eCommerce features and functionalities. In particular on the checkout and account features.
These limitations can be overcome with the use of third-party tools. JamStack ecosystem is already huge and it comes with plenty of API options.
Some of these options can be integrated using directly Webflow Ecommerce elements, some of others can be used just using Webflow CMS instead.


## Webflow CMS
