The **Udesly App** converts your Webflow project .zip into an [**11ty**](https://www.11ty.dev/) theme. It analyzes your theme and adds all the necessary *Liquid* code, so that you don't need to! 


Design your eCommerce in Webflow like a normal site, your design will be converted along with your interactions, fonts, and your CMS elements. Your eCommerce functionalities will be handled natively by [**Snipcart**](https://snipcart.com/). But you can use other third-party eCommerce too!

The **Udesly App** is smart enough to understand your Site structure through the **magic extension**, it will automatically configure your template and export your *CMS data*. Yep, you have read it correctly!

Your CMS collections will be automatically linked and editable from Netlify CMS admin panel (or the markdown files if you don't want to use it!)
