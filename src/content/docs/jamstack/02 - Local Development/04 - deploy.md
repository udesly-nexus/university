It's really easy to build and deploy an 11ty theme on your own hosting, just follow these simple steps!

1. Open a terminal window;

2. Move the current working directory to your unzipped theme, by using the command:

```bash
cd "Full path to the unzipped folder"
```

3. Launch the command:

```bash
npm i && npm run build
```

4. Grab a coffee ☕ while your pc tries to fly out of the desk building your 10000k cms items;

5. Once the process is done, you will find a folder named **public** in your unzipped theme;

6. Upload the **content** of the **public** folder on your hosting with ftp access or wathever system your hosting provider gave you to upload files;
