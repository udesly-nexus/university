To develop your JamStack site locally you will need to have on your pc the following tools:

## Command Line Processor

It's already preinstalled on every OS you use, and allows you to execute commands without using a GUI interface. Every command you will find through this documentation uses *Bash syntax*, but the commands are pretty simple and should work in every terminal. If you are having issues, try to install and use the [**Git Bash**](https://git-scm.com/). 

## NodeJS

Node.jsÂ® is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.

You can download it from [**here**](https://nodejs.org/en/), it's adviced to install at least Node 10.

If you have already Node installed, you can check your version from your command line by using the command:

```bash
node --version
```

If Node is installed you should see as output something like this:

```bash
v16.3.0
```

## Text Editor

To modify Markdown files you can just use any Text editor. It's greatly adviced you use [**Visual Studio Code**](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
It's open source, fast, has tons of extension and it's available on every OS.
