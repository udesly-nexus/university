Every form that in Webflow has as action (webflow default) as in the following screen

![](/images/form-name.png)

Will be converted as a Netlify Form.

Naturally if you are not hosting on Netlify, using Netlify forms is pretty useless. In this case you have different options:

1. Select a third party forms provider from [**this list**](https://jamstacktools.org/browse/all/form);

2. Create a script on your server, probably your hosting provider supports running PHP scripts;

For both options, you just have to set the correct action in your Webflow Form.
