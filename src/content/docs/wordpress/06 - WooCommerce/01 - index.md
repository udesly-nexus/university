[**WooCommerce**](https://woocommerce.com/) is a customizable, open-source eCommerce platform built on WordPress.
It's the eCommerce platform you will use instead of Webflow eCommerce if you convert your site into WordPress.

There is no particular configuration you have to keep in mind for your Ecommerce site. Just create your Webflow site as a normal eCommerce site using Webflow eCommerce elements, and your site will be automatically configured in the same way in WooCommerce.

The checkout that will be used is the default Checkout, while the Checkout (Paypal) page will be deleted.

Some pages of WooCommerce are not mappable 1 to 1 into Webflow, because Webflow for now doesn't have them, like **Cart page** and **My Account page**. Unfortunately for now the App has not already reached feature parity, so you have to use them with shortcodes, that you will find in next page. üôá‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
