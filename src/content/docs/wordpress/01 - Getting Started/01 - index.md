The **Udesly App** is a web app that allows you to *adapt* your Webflow theme in order to be used with different CMSes.  


## Why?

Why you should use the *Udesly App* in the first place? ðŸ¤”

Webflow! an amazing design tool! ðŸŽ¨ And we wanted to use Webflow everyday and in every kind of projects!

Every tool has its own *pros*, *cons* and *best use cases*, but we didn't want to give up on Webflow at least as design tool when our customers needed a different CMS or needed to cover functionalities not yet available. 

That's why we built up the **App**, to use Webflow **all the time**... And also to not bother up our devs with boring task like *writing html markup*...

It's just a way to mix up different tools and get the best of all worlds! âœ¨

In this case, let's be specific and let's start our journey to the [**WordPress**](https://wordpress.org/). 

## WordPress

We know, WordPress is not the shiniest kid on the market anymore. But it still has a lot of things to say to the world! And a lot of plugins to cover all your customers needs! And if you are a PHP dev, is the most flexible platform available right now. You can modify everything you need on the backend and add any custom function you need!

### Pros
Below there are some features that might let you consider WordPress as platform to use:

1. Real gated content (*will be possible in Webflow later this year);
2. A lot more payment gateways supported, like iDeal, Klarna, Afterpay and so on;
3. User management;
4. Unlimited CMS items;
5. A familiar interface for you customers;
6. No vendor lock in, WordPress is open-source and you can host wherever you want, your data will be always your data;
7. An infinite plugin marketplace;
8. A pretty vast community of developers;
9. Limits on forms are defined by your hosting and usually there are no limits;
10. You can host in Europe so less headaches for GDPR.

### Cons
Naturally WordPress is not the perfect platform at all, and has some cons:

1. Higher maintenance;
2. Performance are highly dependant on quality of hosting, server and cache configuration;
3. Requires a bit of learning;


## Requirements

In order to use the App you need to meet the following requirements:

* An active Udesly plan (**Premium** or **All Access**);
* A [Webflow Account plan](https://webflow.com/pricing#account) in order to export your Webflow project;
* Our [magic Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/udesly-template-configura/khhgdnefpkphamogndglabaalbpfidbf) ðŸ§™
* A theme made in Webflow.


> You don't need to get a *site* plan on Webflow, your site will be hosted on Netlify platform (or any hosting you wish if you want to just compile the theme).
