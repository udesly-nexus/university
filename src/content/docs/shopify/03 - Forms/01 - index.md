All the forms require a little of attention. The purpose of the form is declared with the **Form Name** that is a field that can be set in Webflow Element Settings:

![form name](/images/form-name.png)

For example **Subscribe** declares a form that can be used to **Subscribe** to your shop! 

Almost all forms requires an input type **Email**. There are many and many different type of forms convertible using the Udesly App! Just select the type of form you need from the list below and configure it!

Note: if you don't want your form to be converted (because you have some JS controlling it), just add an action that starts with https, on the *action* field of the form settings.
