* Static Attributes

<custom-attribute name="name" value="value"></custom-attribute> 

These attributes are static, so do not change them, just copy the left part inside *Name* and the right part inside *Value*. To copy faster, you can just press on name and on value, they will copy the value to clipboard so you don't need to rewrite them!



* Dynamic Attributes

<custom-attribute dynamic name="name" value="dynamic-value"></custom-attribute> 

These attributes are dynamic, and it means that the name can be copied, but the value can change according to the situation and will be explained time by time.
