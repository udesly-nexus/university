The **Udesly App** converts your Webflow project .zip in a Shopify theme. It analyzes your theme and adds all the necessary *Liquid* code, so that you don't need to!* 



Design your eCommerce in Webflow like a normal site, your design will be converted along with your interactions, fonts, and your CMS elements.

The **Udesly App** is smart enough to understand your Site structure through the **magic extension**, it will automatically configure your template and export your *CMS data*. Yep, you have read it correctly!



<div class="center"> <img alt="magic" src="/images/magic.gif" /></div>



Your CMS collections will be automatically linked and editable from Shopify admin panel as different Blogs, even custom fields that normally are not available in Shopify!

<small>* If you are a Liquid Ninja ðŸ¥· you can add ultra-advanced features directly in Webflow using our *Liquid Elements*</small>



> **Disclaimer:** All Webflow elements, even dynamic ones and CMS bindings inside embeds will be converted correctly without configuration. However there is a small part of features that is available only in Shopify and, needs a bit of configuration inside Webflow, you need to use *custom attributes*. Don't worry it's not a long list and you can copy directly the pre-configured elements from this doc!
