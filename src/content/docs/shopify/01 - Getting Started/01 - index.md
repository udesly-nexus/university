The **Udesly App** is a web app that allows you to *adapt* your Webflow theme in order to be used with different CMSes.  



## Why?

Why you should use the *Udesly App* in the first place? ðŸ¤”

Webflow! an amazing design tool! ðŸŽ¨ And we wanted to use Webflow everyday and in every kind of projects!

Every tool has its own *pros*, *cons* and *best use cases*, but we didn't want to give up on Webflow at least as design tool when our customers needed a different CMS or needed to cover functionalities not yet available. 

That's why we built up the **App**, to use Webflow **all the time**... And also to not bother up our devs with boring task like *writing html markup*...

It's just a way to mix up different tools and get the best of all worlds! âœ¨

In this case, let's be specific and let's start our journey to **Shopify**. 



## Requirements

In order to use the App you need to meet the following requirements:

* An active Udesly license (**Free** or **Premium**);
* A [Webflow Workspace Account plan](https://webflow.com/pricing) in order to export your Webflow project;
* Our [magic Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/udesly-template-configura/khhgdnefpkphamogndglabaalbpfidbf) ðŸ§™
* Our [Shopify App](https://apps.shopify.com/udesly-webflow-importer) to import your Webflow data, automatically create the pages and manage metafields;
* A theme made with eCommerce Elements



> You don't need to get a *site* plan on Webflow, your site will be hosted on Shopify platform.
