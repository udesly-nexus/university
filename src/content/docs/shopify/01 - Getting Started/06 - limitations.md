Well... not all that glitters is gold!

Below you can find a list of limitations that hopefully will be resolved in the future, but you should be aware before converting. 



## Webflow

1. Elements regarding the **Account** functionalities still need to be made with *Custom Attributes*;
2. The **Cart** page (not the Mini Cart), that is not mandatory, needs a specific configuration since there's no comparable element in Webflow;



## Shopify

1. Theme max size in **MB** is 50. You can't upload theme that are bigger than **50MB**, the Udesly App will refuse to convert such sites, to avoid bad sorrows when you will upload the theme inside Shopify;
2. The max number of translation keys is hard capped at 3000. The Udesly App will fail to convert and ask you to disable translations if your site has a lot more texts;
3. The page permalink structure is defined and not changeable, all your pages will be under the path /pages/, *e.g: your page contact-us in Webflow, will be /pages/contact-us in Shopify*;
4. **Checkout** is not modifiable, in Shopify you can just upload a css file and only if you have a **Shopify Plus** plan ($299+);
5. Shopify as CMS is pretty limited and only allows you to create *Blogs*, fortunately you can create unlimited *Blogs*, so the Udesly App will create 1 different *blog* for each CMS collection you created in Webflow, but the permalink structure is locked also here. *e.g: if you created a collection called events in Webflow, you will find it under /blog/events in Shopify* and you can't change it;




## Udesly App

1. Some Shopify functionalities are not convertible yet and are available only through *Liquid Elements*;
2. Sections conversion has not reached feature parity with old Udesly App;
3. Integrations with third party Shopify apps needs better support and explanations with examples for the most important and used apps;
4. Video Field doesn't work correctly yet;


## Shopify App

1. Featured images of variation are imported as product images so they must be attached manually after import;
