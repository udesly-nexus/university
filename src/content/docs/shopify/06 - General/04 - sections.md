Sections are modular, customizable elements of a page, which can have specific functions.

A section can be created on a limited number of element tags: (Article, Header, Footer, Aside, Div and Section).

Every **Component** you create in Webflow will be automatically transformed into a **snippet** or a **section** if relevant options for the section are included in it.

Inside components, you can add several options that will create the dynamic parts of your section.

Webflow Component properties are automatically converted as section options without the needing for attributes. Note also that Sections data is global and not modifiable page by page.

> ⚠️⚠️⚠️: Only inside sections you can add options, don't add option on the section itself!

## Blocks
Blocks are a dynamic way to add multiple times a single element, and they can contain every option already listed before. So think about it as a way to add real dynamic features to some of your elements. For example, with blocks you can create a dynamic slider adding the block to 1 slide of the slider, in this way for each block that your customer create, a new slide will be generated. Note that like for sections, options can be added only inside blocks and not on the block itself. To create a block just add the attribute:

<custom-attribute dynamic name="block" value="block name"></custom-attribute>
