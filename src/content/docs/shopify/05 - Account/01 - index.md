In this section you will find all functionalities regarding Accounts, that have no 1 to 1 equivalent with Webflow and can't be converted automatically. ðŸ¤•

Fortunately they are not a lot and most of them are totally optional, you are not forced to create them in any case!

Do not forget that by default Shopify accounts are **disabled**. you need to enable them from the Shopify settings area, follow the [**official guide**](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/checkout-settings/customer-accounts) to enable them.
